## Learn Vim

Welcome to the most unique tutorial on Vim -- the best text-editor on the planet!

### Features:
- Very comprehensive
- Useful for novices and professionals alike
- No screenshots! Supposed to be followed with Vim open alongside

### Modules:
We will learn Vim over seven modules:

* [The Forgotten One] (modules/module0.md)
* [(Not just an) Intro](modules/module1.md)
* [BTW (Buffers, Tabs, Windows)](modules/module2.md)
* [Being Normal](modules/module3.md)
* [Coderz](modules/module4.md)
* [Plug n Play](modules/module5.md)
* [That's not all, Folks!](modules/module6.md)

The zeroeth module is a precursor to the tutorial.
The first three modules will be concerned with vanilla (read 'pure') Vim.
The fourth module will introduce some external tools and tips for coding in Vim.
The fifth module will touch upon some popular useful plugins.
The sixth module will give an insight into some advanced concepts, and tell you how to learn more.

As on December 11th, the first three modules are already live!
I plan to release each subsequent module on a weekend.
The link for each unreleased module lists the topics planned to be covered in that module.
The idea is that by the end (that is, on New Year's Day), you should be able to call yourself a _Vim expert_.
So let's get started with [(Not just an) Intro](modules/module1.md).
