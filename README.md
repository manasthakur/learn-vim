## Learn Vim

Welcome to the most unique tutorial on Vim -- the best text-editor on the planet!

### Features:
- Very comprehensive
- Useful for novices and professionals alike
- No screenshots! Supposed to be followed with Vim open alongside

### Modules:
We will learn Vim over the following modules:

* [Module Zero: The Forgotten One] (modules/module0.md)
* [(Not just an) Intro](modules/module1.md)
* [BTW (Buffers, Tabs, Windows)](modules/module2.md)
* [Being Normal](modules/module3.md)
* [Coderz](modules/module4.md)
* [Plug n Play](modules/module5.md)
* [That's not all, Folks!](modules/module6.md)

The zeroeth module is a precursor to the tutorial.
The next three modules are concerned with vanilla (read 'pure') Vim.
_Coderz_ introduces some tips and external tools for coding in Vim.
_Plug n Play_ touches upon some popular useful plugins.
The last module gives an insight into some advanced concepts, and tells you how to learn more.
The idea is that by the end, you should be able to call yourself an _Advanced Vimmer_.
So let's get started with [(Not just an) Intro](modules/module1.md).

This series started as a weekend-ly release in November 2016; and the last
module was released on January 1st, 2017.
