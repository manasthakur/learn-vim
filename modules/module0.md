## Learn Vim - Module 0: The Forgotten One

[Home](https://github.com/manasthakur/learn-vim/)  |  [Next module](module1.md)

_To err is Human. To admit is Humane. To correct is Humanity._

This module is a set of things that I had forgotten to add before starting out with the other modules.

### Which Vim?

There are two kinds of Vim available -- one that runs in your terminal emulator, and another that runs as an independent graphical application.
The terminal one comes by default on most operating systems.
However, it might not be the latest one.

* On _Linux_ systems, you can install `vim-enhanced` to get the recent terminal-vim using your favorite package manager.
The package to install the graphical-vim (gvim) is `vim-gnome` (Debian/Ubuntu) and `vim-X11` (Fedora).

* On macOS, you can install `vim` using HomeBrew to get the recent terminal-vim.
The package to install the graphical-vim (MacVim) is `macvim`.

The examples I use in this tutorial are tested on Vim version 8, released in 2016.
Whenever I discuss something that I know not to be working in some specific older versions of Vim, I will try to mention the same.

### Getting help

Vim has an excellent documentation built-in, which can be accessed from inside Vim using the command:
```
:help
```
The documentation for a particular setting can be accessed using `:help option-name`.

The best way to start learning Vim is using _vimtutor_, which comes by default with Vim.
You can access it be typing `vimtutor` in your command-prompt.

#### Disclaimer
_This tutorial is just a small set of the features of Vim. It is neither complete, nor completely correct. You may encounter non-standard terminology and beware of it. However, do point out whenever something is wrong, and I would be happy to correct the mistakes._
